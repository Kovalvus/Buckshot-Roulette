A full recreation of the first version of Buckshout Roulette By Mike Klubnika I made in Python!

Works entirely inside the console

The included txt files are files I made during the concept phase for those curious

I also included a .exe version of the game, should work the same as .py for to be 100% sure the game works launch the .py :)

All info needed to play you'll find under the Help section after launching the game, and technical stuff is all explained inside the code 

Enjoy!
